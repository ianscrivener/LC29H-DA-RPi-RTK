### Copilot's Suggestions

Here are some suggestions to improve your code:

#### 1. Thread Safety for Global Variables
You use global variables like latest_gga, latest_rmc, and utc_date across threads. Consider using thread-safe mechanisms (e.g., locks) if these are updated/read in multiple threads.


#### 2. Exception Handling Granularity
In process_serial_data, the outer try block catches all exceptions, which may hide bugs. Consider more granular exception handling and logging.

#### 3. Resource Cleanup
In main(), you close tcp_server and ntrip_session if they exist, but these may not be properly initialized or may already be closed. Add checks or use context managers where possible.

#### 4. Magic Numbers and Defaults
Use named constants for values like buffer sizes (1024), timeouts, etc., for clarity.

#### 5. File Writing Robustness
In LightweightGPSLogger._write_buffer_to_file, if writing fails, you put data back in the buffer. Consider logging the error to a separate file or alerting the user if this happens repeatedly.

#### 6. GPS Data Logging
The header in the log file includes geometry_wkt, but you do not write this field. Either remove it from the header or add support for WKT geometry.


#### 7. Graceful Shutdown
The shutdown sequence is good, but you may want to join threads (e.g., the logger thread) to ensure all data is flushed before exit.


#### 8. Parsing Robustness
NMEA parsing functions could be more robust against malformed sentences. Consider stricter validation and error reporting.

#### 9. TCP Client Handling
In broadcast_to_clients, you remove disconnected clients. Consider logging which clients were disconnected for easier debugging.


#### 10. Code Structure
The file is quite large. Consider splitting into modules: serial handling, TCP server, NTRIP client, logging, etc.
